NOTE: This will only work on a MacBook, Codespaces on GitHub, Linux, FreeBSD. DO NOT attempt it on PowerShell. 
1. Create an sqlite3 database:
	touch Volcanoes.db 
   This will create a zero byte file. Nest you create the tables in the file.
2. Create the tables by running the script CreateTable.sql
	sqlite3 Volcanoes.db < CreateTable.sql
   This will create the table(s) with the settings you specify. Next you add data.
3. Check the export file and ensure it is comma delimited.
	1,"Pelee","Violent","Martinique",0,"1932",
	2,"Mauna Loa","Quiet","Hawaii",10,"1984",
	3,"Tarawera","Violent","New Zealand",0,"1886",
4. Run import_data.py:
	python import_data.py
5. Run selectAll.sql:
	sqlite3 Volcanoes < selectAll.sql

Now you have a populated table in your database.

1,"Pelee","Violent","Martinique",0,"1932",
2,"Mauna Loa","Quiet","Hawaii",10,"1984",
3,"Tarawera","Violent","New Zealand",0,"1886",
